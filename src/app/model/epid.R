# COVID model
# epid function, which sets the initial conditions [based on parmlist] and calls the solver to run the model

import::from('./covid_model_det.R', covid_model_det)

###################################################################################################
# the epid function has one argument = the parameter list which can be one
# set of paramters, or a matrix or data.frame of parameters
# the parameters include initial conditions like seeding
# the epid function therefore sets up the initial conditions and runs the ODE model
# the output is returned as a data frame with column headings for the state variables
# from the covid_model_det function (state variables, as well as any other outputs like
# cummulative incidence)
# the output also includes the parameter values for each simulation
